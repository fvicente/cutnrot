# cutnrot
A python script that uses wxPython to edit your scanned images (JPEG, BMP, TIFF, etc.) obtain sub-images, rotate and save them. This first version is very basic but effective, no necessity of learning complex commands or image handling programs, just:
* click in the upper-left corner
* click in the lower-right corner
* rotate if you wish
* close and save
